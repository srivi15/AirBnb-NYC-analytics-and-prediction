# AirBnb-NYC-analytics-and-prediction
This project is done on AirBnb NYC data set from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data. The data analytics and visualizations are performed and then the predictive model is built to predict the price.


The data set has the following attributes/features:

-> `id` - id of the person                                                    int64

-> `name` - name of the person                                                object

-> `host_id` - id of the host                                                 int64

-> `host_name` - name of the host                                             object

-> `neighbourhood_group` - neighbourhood groups                               object

-> `neighbourhood` - names of the neighbourhood                               object

-> `latitude` - latitude of the region                                        float64

-> `longitude` - longitude of the region                                      float64

-> `room_type` - type of the room                                             object

-> `price` - price of the room                                                int64

-> `minimum_nights` - minimum number of nights in the room                    int64

-> `number_of_reviews` - total number of reviews given                        int64

-> `last_review` - the date of the review which was given last                datetime64[ns]

-> `reviews_per_month` - number of reviews per month                          float64

-> `calculated_host_listings_count` - total count of the listings of host     int64

-> `availability_365` - availability of the rooms                             int64


With the above features, the dataset is explored, cleaned, preprocessed and analysed with visualisations. Then, the predictive model is built using regression models and the price is predicted.
